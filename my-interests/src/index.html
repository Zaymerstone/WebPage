<p class="tablediv">OK, so now you know about my <b>Top 5 hobbies.</b> But I also have one more inspiring hobby. I really enjoy taking <em><b> sunset </em></b> pictures. Here, I have the most fascinating: <img src="https://novostivolgograda.ru/attachments/4af5c99ec6c5de598ad64a18cd6ddad1cf66afd7/store/fill/1200/675/613383b157583ae6be162edc37c274e9b429e3718cb8a16d511060f3b49b/613383b157583ae6be162edc37c274e9b429e3718cb8a16d511060f3b49b.jpg"id="name"/> <img src="https://lux.fm/uploads/media_news/2020/06/5ef33def07a61632983968.jpg?w=1200&h=675&fit=cover&a=top"id="index"</p>

     The most important thing is to understand "what is a hobby". There are some people who don't have hobbies, who think that hobby doesn't make any sense and other diffrent things. I would like to explain it and hope this information will be very useful for them to find their own pastime. So, how should you choose?</div>
    <table>
      <ul>
      <tr>
        <th>This is hobby</th>
        <th>This isn't hobby</th>
      </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><li>It feels<div>relaxing<div>when you<div>do it.</div></div></div></td>
            <td><li>You are forcing<div>yourself to do it<div>so it's not interesting.</div></div></li></td>
        </tr>
        </li>
      <tr>
        <td><li>You are<div>able to<div>do it in your<div>spare time.</div></div></div></td>
        <td><li>This activity<div>takes your whole time.<div>Hobbies are something that<div>you can do spending<div>your free time.</div></div></div></div></li></td>
      </tr>
      </li>
      <tr>
        <td><li>It inspires<div>you to<div>learn more<div>about it.</div></div></div></td></li>
          <td><li>You can't do anything after<div>this activity.Well, hobby is a pastime<div>that does not waste your energy.</div></div></td></li></tr></ul></table>
Let's see how hobbies can affect your life:
<div><ol><li>Person who has hobby<ul><li>Having a hobby you enjoy makes life more fulfilling, interesting .</li><li>Acquires various important skills.</li><li>Some hobbies are of communal nature, like choral singing and volunteering, so you can make friends!</li></ul><li>Person who doesn't have hobby.</li><ul><li>Spends spare time less interesting.</li><li>Life of such person is less diverse.</li></ul></ol></div>
<div>Finding your own hobby is a perfect chance to make your life well-rounded. Saving some time for yourself to enjoy a hobby can provide the physical, mental, emotional, and creative benefits that make life more meaningful, relaxing, and fun! <b>Hobbies are integral part of life!</b></div>
